# Claude Code PreToolUse(Bash) gate — pathscale backend service.
#
# Prompts before prod-affecting / destructive commands in ANY wrapper form
# (env VAR=val …, tool -C <dir> …, chained with ; && |, multi-line, quoted via
# bash -c '…'). For everything else it stays SILENT (exit 0, no decision), so the
# normal permission rules — permissions.allow / ask / deny in .claude/settings.json
# and the session's permission mode — decide as usual.
#
# This is one layer of defense, not a replacement for the permission system: a
# pattern match over a command string is best-effort (quoting and indirection can
# evade any blocklist). It backs up the declarative permissions.ask list in
# .claude/settings.json — KEEP THE TWO IN SYNC — and for fully autonomous runs,
# prefer OS-level sandboxing on top.
#
# Adapted from PakhomovAlexander/project-hub. Edit RISKY_WORDS for this repo;
# tooling; further branches below gate `git`/`docker push`, `git clean`, recursive
# `rm`, `find -delete`, package publishing, PR-merge/release via `gh`, and a deploy
# script run by path. Add your own command families (e.g. `ssh`, a bespoke deploy
# CLI) to RISKY_WORDS, or trim what you don't use — and mirror the change in
# permissions.ask in .claude/settings.json.

# Pull the command out of the hook's stdin JSON. Every check below is a

# left as-is deliberately -- they can only ever cost a match, never invent one.
